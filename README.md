# What do you Meme

## About
In the middle of the pandemic, we had our own share of low-times and bore-times. We felt isolated and it almost felt like a hibernation period. It still seems like that! Memes were to our rescue! We came up with this fun web-app game, What do you meme?. You can have fun with your friends in a room while you think of funny pictures that seem relevant to the given scenario.
